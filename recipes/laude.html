    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Talking about goat meat, there is nowhere better than Ninh Binh mountain goat. Every day, strong herds of goats
        walk on rocky mountains, cool green forest leaves and drink the remaining dew, which reminds them of the
        favorite dish of wild goat meat. From Ninh Binh mountain goat meat, you can prepare a variety of dishes: goat
        blood pudding, raw goat meat, goat meat, fried, steamed... among which, goat blood pudding is probably at the
        top of the list. Making a delicious bowl of Ninh Binh mountain goat soup is not easy. Only a skilled person can
        make a bowl of blood pudding that freezes like a cake but is still soft and sweet when eaten. Goat blood pudding
        is made from the best parts of the goat such as ears, tenderloin and rib meat, added with roasted peanuts,
        sesame seeds, onions, and herbs. The weapon is just right, crispy and fragrant, fragrant with the smell of
        roasted sesame, rich with grilled onions. While gently sketching and taking another sip of clear Dam Khe wine,
        you can call it magic speaking into the clouds.</p>
